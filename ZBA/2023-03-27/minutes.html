        These minutes were produced first by Office 365's voice-to-text
        transcription of an audio recording of the meeting. Then, ZBA software
        was used to drive

          I tried out Microsoft 365 personally, with the intention of testing it
          out to see if I would recommend it to the town. I found that the
          program allowed me to dictate my meeting minutes quickly and
          efficiently. However, I did notice one potential issue with the
          program: when dictating, it is important to speak your name (even if
          it is just your last name) so that the recording can be properly
          attributed to each speaker.
        </p>
        <p>
          Aside from this minor issue, I found the product to be highly
          effective. Although there were occasional instances where words were
          not transcribed correctly (such as "ZBA" being transcribed as
          something else), these were easily fixed in under an hour. Overall, I
          felt that the program was well worth the price.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a result of my positive experience with Microsoft 365, I
          recommended it to the selectmen. They authorized me to purchase the
          product, and I believe it has been an excellent addition to our
          office's workflow.

          I'd like to add that I really liked the last time we voted on the
          minutes. It came out really well, but Mark spent a whole lot of time
          doing it. However, I think this one here will be a lot better and much
          superior. In fact, I think it'll actually cut down on Debbie's time,
          so I was totally in favor of doing this for a while, at least trying
          to get things going.

          I have trouble hearing certain things sometimes when doing my minutes,
          as you mentioned earlier. I believe it would be best to keep things as
          they are, but with the addition of microphones. By extending the
          microphones to both the speaker and the listeners, we can ensure clear
          communication and receipt of messages.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, I think this solution would be effective in improving our
          communication during meetings.

          During the discussion, it was mentioned that the minutes of the March
          13th meeting have not yet been approved. Deb still has some work left
          to do on them, and as a result, the approval will be postponed to the
          next meeting.

          The election of the chairman was also included in the agenda, however,
          since Andrew was not in attendance, it was decided to wait until the
          next meeting to hold the election. This decision was made with the
          intention of allowing all members to participate in the process of
          electing a new chairman.

          Furthermore, it was announced that the next meeting is scheduled for

          discussed at the time, it was confirmed that the next meeting will
          take place on this date.

          Mr. Chair, I have some comments to preface the meeting. If I may, I
          would like to lead directly into our investigation on the motion.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first note that I made to myself was asking the Chair if he might
          recall that at the end of the last meeting we were approached by a
          selectman. The selectman suggested that it may not be appropriate for
          the chair to make a motion.

          During that meeting, they offered us what I thought was good advice.
          They suggested we make the meetings more robust. Curious, I decided to
          investigate further. After reading Roberts' Rules of Order, I
          discovered that the chair does indeed have the power to motion, but it
          is not recommended for twelve member boards or more. For boards of
          three members or less, it is quite common.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although the advice was well-intended and I didn't want to dismiss it,
          I believe that since we are not bound by Roberts' Rules of Order, we
          should make our own decision regarding this matter. In fact, we have
          our own rules of procedure which will dictate how we conduct our
          meetings and how we plan for future meetings. Ultimately, I leave it
          up to the group to decide whether or not to follow this advice.

          There is a strict time limit of 30 days for filing an appeal. It is
          important to note that the appeal before us was made in a timely
          manner, but upon reviewing the notice of decision from our last
          meeting, I realized that we had issued a condition subsequent
          requesting that errors and omissions in the permit application be
          fixed, regarding the construction of the second story. Although this
          condition was agreed upon at the meeting, it has not been fulfilled.
          As a board, we do not have enforcement powers, so we can only make
          note of this and move on.

          Additionally, I came across RSA 677:3 while preparing for this
          meeting, which stated that motions raised in a motion for rehearing
          are considered final. This information provided some guidance for my
          thoughts.
        </p>

          Initially, I thought that it might be as simple as taking a vote on
          the standard for our review. However, I now believe that in this
          meeting, we need to answer two questions. The first question is
          whether the motion contains any new evidence or arguments to cause any
          consideration. The second question is if the board acted unlawfully or
          unreasonably at the original hearing.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think it's what we have to look at tonight to satisfy ourselves
          whether we should grant or deny the motion for a hearing. However, the
          current situation doesn't make sense to me.

          After some consideration, I expressed to myself that we should address
          two questions before deciding on whether to grant or deny the
          rehearing. I suggest that we discuss these questions tonight. To get
          the conversation started, I prepared notes on two topics: new evidence
          and the issue of whether we acted lawfully and reasonably.
        </p>
        <p>
          Regarding new evidence, the motion for the rehearing claims that the
          second story of the proposed building is an inevitable consequence of
          the sloped roof. However, I wanted to challenge this argument as I
          have seen many structures with sloped roofs that have empty space
          below or exposed rafters. Therefore, I do not give much weight to this
          claim.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, I divided my notes into two parts and discussed each
          separately. My aim was to provide information that could help us make
          an informed decision about the rehearing.

          It was just a simple question. It started as a simple question from me
          as I looked at something we hadn't seen before. We were given a more
          complete set of plans which showed the elevation. All we needed was a
          foundation plan to do our thing. I questioned it offhand, not that we
          had anything to do with it. However, it seemed to take off from that
          point.

          I would like to bring up a second point, which concerns the argument
          regarding what I call the "zombie claim." This claim pertains to the
          alternate definition of "unnecessary hardship," and it was not present
          in the original May 2nd, 2022 application. However, it was introduced
          in the June 30th, 2022 motion for rehearing, and subsequently dropped
          in the November 28th, 2022 re-application. Interestingly, it has
          resurfaced once again in the March 1st, 2023 motion for a rehearing.
        </p>
        <p>
          It may be useful to recall that the alternate definition of
          unnecessary hardship is described in the state's official ZBA
          handbook. I'll take the liberty of reading it out here.

          And if you remember, we discussed this at length back in July. I guess
          it was in July last year that we were talking about this. We rejected
          the claim then, and what I propose in front of us now is that we
          reject it again. This is because the property is actually being used
          right now as the applicant's residence. The house is there as
          permitted by prior variances or LUO 402 nonconforming uses. I'll reach
          for the same section of the handbook.

          In summary, we previously discussed this claim in July last year and
          rejected it. We should reject it again because the property is being
          currently used as the applicant's residence. The house is permitted by
          prior variances or LUO 402 nonconforming uses.

          I would like to reiterate my rejection of the claim of the alternative
          definition of unnecessary hardship. This is the second time I am
          stating this, as I do not see it as a viable option.

          Moving on to the next point, let's discuss the stormwater management
          improvements mentioned in the motion. According to the original
          application, the proposal will only increase the impervious surface by
          394 square feet. Additionally, the motion claims that the stormwater
          management improvements will have a positive impact on the environment
          of Highland Lake and the general public. These are facts that we have
          received from the motions.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is important to consider these details when making any decisions
          regarding the proposal. While the impervious surface increase may seem
          small, the potential impact on the environment must be carefully
          considered. Likewise, the potential benefits of the stormwater
          management improvements must also be thoroughly examined.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, we must carefully evaluate all aspects of the proposal before
          making any decisions. Only through thoughtful consideration can we
          ensure that our actions will have a positive impact on the community
          and environment.

          I noticed on this application that under the "background and
          description" section, it states that the existing driveway has no
          stormwater management system. This means that sediment is able to run
          down into Highland Lake. However, the proposal includes plans for
          stormwater management improvements which will reduce runoff and
          erosion. Unfortunately, I am not entirely sure how they plan to
          accomplish this.
        </p>
        <p>
          I remember being there during the beginning stages of this project
          when the driveway was simply made of gravel. Despite the proposed
          changes, the driveway will still remain a gravel driveway.

          Right, so I am thinking, how can there be a net improvement over
          having a structure in place, when compared to not having it there at
          all? As you mentioned, the existing parking apron is categorized as
          impervious, but not all impervious surfaces are created equal. It's
          gravel and crushed stone, just like my own parking area, which is also
          classified as impervious, but it's not entirely impervious.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, if a building is constructed over that area, it will actually be
          guaranteed to be 100% impervious, which means that it doesn't matter
          what happens in the stormwater management system. While it definitely
          helps once the structure has been made, I can't accept the claim that
          it handles stormwater better than just having a pervious surface. To
          my mind, having the surface that already exists is much better.

          Can you bring up pictures? There was one, not the elevations, that
          caught my attention. I thought they were going to add something down

          referring to is located here. They are going to work on drainage, but
          I thought there was going to be a horizontal one.

          There was another picture that went all the way down to the water. In

          I had some theoretical objections to the stormwater structure, as I
          didn't believe it could handle the stormwater better than without the
          structure. Additionally, the claim of net improvement didn't make
          sense to me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moving on to the alleged unlawful or unreasonable acts in the motion,
          there was an implication that the board acted unlawfully by not
          rendering a decision on the setback variances, as they were considered
          minor. However, based on my research reading Housing Appeals Board
          decisions, I believed we acted reasonably by holding a decision in
          abeyance for possible reconsideration, citing the Graham v. E Kingston
          case as a precedent. I also believed we did Caruso a favor by not
          rejecting the variances immediately, as either could possibly be
          acceptable in a different application.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another issue was the characterization of the proposal as a two-story
          addition, with the claim in the motion that the second story was
          improperly used as a basis for the denial. However, I believed we
          acted reasonably by relying on the engineering drawing which clearly
          labeled it as a second story. I also believed that the proposal was
          accurately classified as a two-story addition and that calling it
          merely a garage would minimize its impact. We did not use the second
          story as a basis for denial, but rather to accurately characterize
          what was before us.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, I believed the board acted reasonably and did not act
          improperly in making our decisions based on the information presented
          to us.

          That's exactly right. It started off just as a not an off the cuff. It
          started off as an innocuous question and it seemed to stumble from
          there. And when we were coming up with our decision, that did not
          enter into the fact. I would have made the same decision had it been
          just a one story with no space above. The decision would have been
          exactly the same, the same amount of water that's coming off the roof,
          the same amount of everything is happening. I suppose if I went out on
          a limb and I said and they said it was three stories, you would have
          got the same thing. Although going three stories would probably put it
          over the height of 35', that's beside the point. At no time was our
          decision about the stories.

          There is a new subject that the appeal relies heavily on the
          configuration of neighboring properties to justify the proposal on the
          public interest, spirit of the ordinance, and unnecessary hardship
          prongs. However, I believe that we acted reasonably in rejecting these
          arguments. We did so on the grounds that the neighbors are free to
          redevelop their properties as they see fit, and that any advantage
          today could be a disadvantage tomorrow.

          I remember saying it at the meeting, of course, that for such
          non-conforming lots, the owners are free to seek and be granted
          variances to further their development. As a result, we said to
          ourselves that the applicant has no control over the neighboring
          property's actions. They are going to act completely independently,
          and to rely on their layout, their configuration, and the distance of
          their setback of their houses, to help justify this proposal is not
          reasonable.

          I agree that the variance goes with the property, not with the owner.
          If the current owners sell their property tomorrow, the new owners
          could have completely different plans. Another point raised in the
          motion is our consideration of overcrowding and aesthetics as we try
          to judge the proposal on the public interest and spirit of the
          ordinance prongs.

          I believe that we acted reasonably and lawfully by concluding that the
          building and permeable coverages unduly and to a marked degree
          conflict with LUO, which is one of the basic zoning objectives. We
          have stated this several times and provided the reasons for our
          decision fully in the minutes of the hearing and the notice of
          decision.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also found a relevant case, Soukup v. Gilford, where the Housing
          Appeals Board concluded that the ZBA did not act unreasonably or
          unlawfully when it focused on the aesthetics of the neighborhood and
          the desire to avoid the appearance of overcrowding. This case helped
          me to figure that we were doing something reasonable because the
          Housing Board had already made similar decisions in other cases.
        </p>
        <p>
          In summary, our decision was based on the zoning objectives and the
          public interest, and we acted reasonably and lawfully.

          In my final statement, I want to discuss the issue of uniqueness and
          the equal burden of the ordinance. In the original application
          submitted in November, there was a claim made that the property is
          unique due to its size and configuration, specifically because it is
          small, narrow, and closely nestled next to Highland Lake. However,
          there is contention on the determination of uniqueness, which was a
          main point of discussion.
        </p>
        <p>
          To determine the meaning of unique, we consulted the dictionary and
          found that it means "different to all others." We also looked at
          another Housing Appeals Board case, DeSantis v. Salem, which supports
          this interpretation. What is unreasonable is the tortuous definition
          in the motion of "different to at least one."" It doesn't make sense
          to define unique as meaning "different to at least one."
        </p>
        <p>
          In our original July notice of decision, we demonstrated that the
          applicants lot is identical in size and configuration to 64% of the
          lots closely nestled next to Highland Lake and 67% of the lots on the
          same street. We have plenty of documentation to back this up,
          including a table of the number of lots with their acreage and other
          details.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another claim made by the applicants is that their property is
          burdened differently from the other lots in the area. We believe that
          the proper test for unnecessary hardship is: if the property is
          burdened by the zoning restriction in a manner that is distinct from
          other similarly situated property, then it may merit a variance.
        </p>
        <p>
          We defined "similarly situated property" as the lots surrounding the
          shoreland of Highland Lake. This definition was reasonable, as the
          Carusos also characterize their lot as "closely nestled next to
          Highland Lake." Therefore, we think it's a decent characterization of
          the neighborhood.
        </p>
        <p>
          One question we had to consider is whether the burden of the lot
          coverage requirements falls unfairly upon the Caruso's lot because of
          its small size. We found that its size is essentially identical to 64%
          of similarly situated lots. So, in the absence of special conditions,
          is it circular reasoning to grant the variance simply because the lot
          is small? We believe it is.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, we spent a lot of time discussing whether the proposed
          variances are reasonable. We looked at the Harborside case and how
          they approved marquee signs of 25 square feet because they were
          "reasonable and not overly aggressive." We followed the same reasoning
          and concluded that the proposed addition to the Caruso's property is
          not reasonable, given its size and the variances required.
        </p>
        <p>
          In summary, I reinforce my belief that we should deny the variances
          based on the evidence and reasoning presented.

          I agree as well. I feel that they have not done anything to change the
          paperwork. It still says the same thing as before.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's frustrating to feel like no progress has been made. It would be
          nice to see them take action and make meaningful changes to the
          system. Until then, we're left dealing with the same old paperwork and
          bureaucracy. Hopefully, someone will step up and take the necessary
          steps to improve the situation.
