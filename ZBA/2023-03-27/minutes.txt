Carney*: Itâ€™s time to call the ZBA to order at 7:01 pm before I go any further, I'm going to let Deb speak on the recording procedures. 

 DeFosse: I tried Microsoft 365 I purchased it personally just to test it out to see if I can recommend it to the town so with the new Microsoft 365 it dictating my minutes very quickly, sorry transcribed,  and so it wasn't a very long process before all that I have seen is one and I think you can correct this is when you speak you say your name even just the last name and then speak so this way if I'm not here and you're doing a recording and I got the tape I know who spoke so that's the only down last minute I've been working on is I had to think so other than that you know the product does repeat words like sometimes ZBA is not picked up as ZBA but for an hours' worth  making those corrections. I showed the selection and I thought it was worth the price. The selectmen authorized me to purchase it.

Carney:  I'd like to add that I really liked the last time we voted on the minutes it came out really well but Mark spent a whole lot of time doing it and I think this one here will be a lot better and much superior and I think it'll actually cut down on Debbie's time so I was totally in favor of doing this for a while at least you know trying to you know get things going. 

DeFosse:  You know like you said I can't hear certain things sometimes when I'm doing my minutes and so I just feel that we keep it the way it is we can add microphones to that so we microphones extends to them and to us so we can you know get clear messages to it so I think it will work. 

Carney*:  Thank you for speaking on the recording of our minutes.

Carney*: The members present tonight myself Gary Carney chairman, Mark Florence vice chairman, Linda Marshall and Andrew hatch is absent tonight, and our administrator assistant Deb DeFosse.  

Carney: we won't be approving the minutes of March 13th Deb still has some work to do on them they will be ready for the next meeting since Andrew is not here, we will wait until the next meeting for the election of chairman that will take place on the next meeting which I do not have my calendar out April 29th will be our next meeting, 

Florence*: April 26th will be our next meeting. I'm all set for that.

Florence:  Mr. chair I did have some comments to preference the meeting if I may lead directly up to our investigation on the motion so the first note that I made to myself was Mr. chair do you might recall that at the end of the last meeting we were approached by the selectman who suggested that it may not be appropriate for the chair to make a motion 

Carney*: That is correct.

Florence:  that was good advice intended to make these meetings more robust for so I did a little bit of investigating because I was curious about that. It turns out according to Roberts the chair does have the power to motion, but strongly advised not recommended.  For twelve member boards or more not recommended but three member boards its quite common. Again, it was it was it was well intended good advice that you know like I didn't want to ignore or anything like that so for the purpose of this meeting I leave it up to you of course you know to make your own decision about that my feeling is that because we're not bound by Roberts we're actually as our own rules of procedure that by what we do with these meetings what we might want to do in the future meeting. 

Florence: There is a strict 30 day time limit for the appeal to be made and I wanted to know for the record that the that the appeal coming before us that was made in a timely fashion so it's before us not to analyze however once I was reviewing the notice of decision that we issued last time I reminded myself that we issued a condition subsequent to that asking that as a condition of the this meeting here you know here hearing what am I trying to say meeting to discuss motions for rehearing that before that that the errors on page four and the emissions on Page Six of the permit application will be fixed and not only that but see over town but the second story should be made and in fact that was agreed I wrote to the minutes and that was agreed on but that would happen it hasn't happened and I want to point that out for the record that the board of course has no enforcement powers it's just you know the phase of all the projects that fee has not been paid and I just want to I think we can do about it now except note it and move on.  Another thing that I wanted to kind of our own all our own edification is that as I was doing some reading to prepare for this, I looked at RSA 677: 3 and then and it was interesting it was interesting to me and it kind of guided me of my thoughts it says that the motions that the issues raised in the in the motion are final and let me read just an extract from the RSA 

Quote*: A motion for rehearing shall set forth fully every ground upon which it is claimed that the decision or order complaint of excuse me complained of is unlawful or unreasonable no ground not set forth at the application shall be urged relied on or given any consideration and this is a good cause.

Florence*: Meaning they can't make any additional arguments without leave of the court as it moves forward. 

 Florence:  initially I thought that it might be as simple as taking a vote on the standard for our review I believe in this meeting is to answer two questions does the motion contain any new evidence or arguments to cause any consideration and did the board act unlawfully or unreasonably at the original hearing. I think it's what we have to look at tonight to satisfy ourselves whether we should grant or deny the motion for hearing.  doesn't make sense.

Carney*: I agree with that.

Marshall*: I agree.

Florence: Once I expressed that to myself, I think appropriate that we should look into both of those questions we should discuss those questions tonight before we make a decision on whether to grant or deny the rehearing.  I mean I can get the ball rolling I did prepare a few notes that I'll talk to if that's OK with you about OK so kind of divided my notes up into two parts new evidence and the issue of whether we acted lawfully and reasonably. So, and I did that by looking at the motion from the rehearing.  So new evidence under the heading of new evidence or arguments the claim is made in the motion that the second story when there's a lot of issues made around the second story of the part of the proposal is an inevitable consequence of the sloped roof and I wanted to challenge that I mean my own garage has a sloped roof below which is empty space and many other buildings I seen sloped roofs but that have exposed rafters for example so I wanted to challenge and that was an argument offered in first and I wanted to challenge that, I don't take add much weight to that.

 Carney:  it was just a a simple question it's started as simple question from me as I looked at something we hadn't seen before which was a more complete set of plans granted all we need is a foundation plan so to speak to do our thing but this time here we were given a set of plans that show the elevation and I just I just questioned it offhand. Not that we had anything to do with it but I just questioned it and it seemed to take off from that point. 

Florence*: Agreed. 

Florence: on my second point and I wanted to raise the issue of the argument of what I called the zombie claim of the alternate definition of unnecessary hardship that claim was absent in the original May 2nd 2022 application it was made in the in the June 30th 2022 motion for rehearing it was dropped in the November 28th 2022  re- application and there was resurfaced and this March 1st 2023 motion for a rehearing, so if you remember there's an alternate definition of unnecessary hardship and I'll I'll read from the state's official ZBA handbook that describes it

Quote*: Alternatively the applicant can satisfy the unnecessary hardship requirement by establishing that because of the special conditions of the property there is no reasonable use that can be made of the property that would be permitted under the ordinance.

Florence: and if you remember we discussed this at length back in I guess it was in July when we were talking about this July  last year that we were talking about this and we rejected the claim then and what I proposed in front of us now that we rejected again because the property actually is being used right now as the  applicants residence the house is there as permitted by prior variances or LUO 402 nonconforming uses and I'll reach for the same section of the handbook

Quote*: if there is any reason to use including an existing one that is permitted under the ordinance this alternative is not available. 

Florence: So what I want to say again for the second time is that I reject this claim of the necessary module the ultimate definition. I just don't see how it's available. let's talk a bit about the stormwater management improvements which is another claim in the motion the original application states that the proposal will only increase the impervious surface by 394 square feet and that its stormwater management improvements will be a net benefit to the environment Highland Lake and the general public with you recall those facts from the motions that we've received.

Carney: I remember it being talked about you know I wouldn't be able to you know go back at it verbatim but I do recall. 

Florence*: This was certainly something we have discussed. 

Marshall: I noticed on this application and under background and description it says existing driveway has no stormwater management system enabling sediment to run down to into highland lake the proposal includes stormwater management improvements which will reduce runoff and erosion and I I'm not sure how they're doing that I mean I was there when we were there way back at the beginning it was a gravel driveway that's still going to be a gravel driveway.

Florence: right, so how kind of along my thoughts  is that how can there be a net improvement over a net improvement over not having the structure there as well so as you say existing parking apron is categorized as impervious but it's not all impervious surfaces are created equal it's graphics crystal right just like mine is which is kind of which is classified but it's not 100% impervious, so the building over that area actually guaranteed absolutely 100% impervious so doesn't to my mind doesn't matter what happens in the stormwater management system yes it definitely helps once the structure has been made but I can't accept the claim that it handles the storm water better than just having a previous surface just having the surface that exists.

Carney:  can you bring up pictures and there was one there was one not the elevations there was one that I thought they were going to add something down here which was supposed to be something for the runoff is this thing here yeah, they're going to do that and drainage but I thought there was going to be a horizontal one. There was one that went all the way down to the water and I thought that I that in here they were going to put something OK I could be wrong.

Florence*: OK I don't see that.

Carney: maybe it was in one of the other ones I don't know I do remember because there was no more to run off here there was a there was a walkway or something and the walkway was going to be removed because they're going to take some square footage from the walkway.nOK that's great you don't see that I don't see anything down here near the IT wasn't between oh it was it was instead of my wife was that stay right there existing walkway yeah, I thought it was going to be under the existing one way or I don't 

Florence: OK I my objections were theoretical but just kind of logical in the sense that to my mind it can't be can't better handle the stormwater with the structure than leaving it without the structure but the claim of the net improvement did not make sense to me that was my issues on new arguments.  I have another set of points about alleged unlawful or unreasonable acts made in the motion the first one was about the setback variances so there's an implication in the motion that the board acted unlawfully by not rendering a decision on the setback variances because they were quote comparatively minor and I had two points about that.  Iâ€™ve been reading all of the housing appeals board decisions it's kind of interesting reading and in Graham versus E Kingston that's a pretty good precedent for holding a decision an obeyance for possible consideration so I felt that we were  on reasonable grounds by doing that and in fact  the Cariso a favor by not rejecting them because we didn't say that we didn't say that they were minor only that they were mute out of the coverage variances which denied and that either one might possibly be acceptable in a different application I don't think we acted reasonably right by doing that.  my next point regarding the claim in the motion that the second story was used as a basis for the trial so there's a claim in that motion that the characterization of the proposal as two-story is problematic but I think we acted quite reasonably by doing so as the engineering drawing which we were just looking at quite clearly says second story, it's like that on the other that we made-up is right there on the on the engineering and there's a further claim that the proposal as a two-story addition is in episode and whether I think the board acted reasonably because as two stores one looking at proposal has two stories and it is and it is an additional it didn't seem to be an option and in fact if our description is inapposite and the description of it as merely a garage is even more I think it I prejudicially minimizes the impact by just calling it that be a garage and I think we were reasonable and for that we didn't we didn't act improperly by relying on the second story as a basis for the denial we didn't we never notice of decision in minutes and we did not use that as a basis of denial, we used it to try and characterize what was before us 

Carney: that's exactly right it was it started off just as a not an off the cuff it started off as a innocuous question and it seemed to stumble from there and when we were coming up with our decision that did not enter into the fact I would have made the same decision had it been just a one story with no space above the decision would have been exactly the same the same amount of water that's coming off the roof the same amount of everything is happening I suppose if I if I went out on a limb and I said and they said it was three stories you would have got the same thing although going three stories would probably put it over the height of 35â€™ that's beside the point at no time was our decision about the stories. 

Florence: There is a new subject that the appeal relies heavily on the configuration of neighboring properties to justify the proposal on the public interest spirit of the ordinance and unnecessary hardship funds but I believe that we acted reasonably in rejecting these arguments on the grounds that the neighbors are free to redevelop their properties as they see fit and that any advantage today could be a disadvantage tomorrow. I remember saying it at the meeting of course that for such lots of non-conforming the owners are free to seek and be granted variances to further that development, so we said to ourselves that the applicant has no control over the neighboring propertyâ€™s that they're going to act completely independently and to rely on their layout their configuration the distance of their setback of their houses to help justify this proposal is not reasonable.

Marshall: except that they abutters are in favor of this and maybe they're not thinking forward or if they turn around and sell their places and someone else wants to do something I mean a lot can change but at the moment the abutters are OK

Florence: yeah this is my speaking again I agree it did although that's independent decision because the variance goes with the property not with the owner  the they sell their property tomorrow and the new owners could have completely different plans there's another point raised in the motion about our consideration of overcrowding and aesthetics as we try to judge the proposal on the public interest and spirit of the ordinance process so I believe that we acted reasonably and lawfully by concluding that the building and permeable coverages unduly and to a marked degree conflict with LUO such they really it's basic zoning objectives we said this several times we said this that we spelled out the reasons for that fully in the minutes of hearing and the notice of decision notice of decision to the to the much more full documentation we made back in the summer I also found that self-help Sucup versus Guilford where the housing appeals board concluded that ZBA did not act unreasonably or unlawfully when it focused on the esthetics of the neighborhood and the desire to avoid the appearance of overcrowding so it helped me to figure that we were doing some reasonable because the housing board had already said in other cases same thing.

 Florence:  final point although it's the one that I think that we had the most contention on and that's the determination of uniqueness and the equal vote of the ordinance if you remember there's a simple unambiguous claim made in the original application, (November I Think)  property is unique in its size and configuration in particular the property is small narrow and closely nestled next to highland lake now I think that we behaved reasonably like consulting the dictionary to determine what unique meant different to all others or even colloquially different to most others right even just informally it means that and another housing appeal case that I found Dasanteâ€™s versus Salem fully supports this interpretation I think what is unreasonable is the torture definition in the motion of different to at least one which never made any sense to me can define unique as meaning different to at least one. We demonstrated in our original July notice of decision that the applicants Caruso lot is identical in size and is essentially identical in size and configuration to 64% of the lots closely nestled next to highland lake and 67% of the lots on the same street, If you know you got quite a bit of documentation that shows like there's a big  table in there the number of lots  that with acreage and so on and it's to stand by that so there's another claim that this property is burdened differently from the other lots in the area and I think that the proper tests are unnecessary hardship is if the property is burdened by the zoning restriction in a manner that is distinct from other similarly situated property so we acted reasonably by defining similarly situated property as the lot surrounding the shoreland of Highland Lake I think that shouldn't be controversial it's reasonable and as the Carusoâ€™s in their own words characterize their lot as closely nestled next to Highland lake, as their characterization of their own lot and I think that's a decent characterization of the neighborhood, so does the burden of the lot coverage requirements fall unfairly upon their lot because of its small size say that right I think thatâ€™s right, so the size is essentially identical to 64% of similarly situated lots in the absence of special conditions is it myself is it circular reasoning that the variance is merited simply because it's so in that motion claim the claim is made that this is small lot and therefore it needs these variances because these variances should be granted because you don't need it because it's should be granted because it's and that seemed like circular reason to me. The final point is that we spend a lot of time talking about this formula do the claimed you know look at the formula to determine unnecessary hardship to the claimed special conditions render the proposed variances reasonable. so the claim special conditions are the size of the left right and the variances of this building help do they make it reasonable so we follow the harbor site if you remember we had a lot of discussion about Harbor side with the Marquee signs and so on and in fact the motion directs us to look at Harbor side and how decide that there was this big discussion in Harbor side approved the marquee signs of 25 square feet marking signs because they were reasonable and not overly aggressive and we saw a lot about that and not overly aggressive it was clearly it was clearly a size that was over 25 feet was OK but 45 ft. 50 ft, 100 square feet that would be OK to Portsmouth ZBA and we followed that change reasoning we said to ourselves that what does the small size of the render this large addition say something I think we going to say about the motion was I was looking at it today actually I just summarized by saying my net conclusion is that documents and denying  I reenforce my belief deny this variance. 

Carney*: I totally agree with that. I think we acted lawfully.

Marshall: I agree as well, I feel they have done anything to change the paper work that the same thing it said before.

Carney*: Yes, OK I agree with that.

Gary*: I think we are ready for a motion.

Florence*: I think we are ready for a vote. 

Florence*:  I move that the board deny the rehearing before us on the grounds that we have acted lawfully and reasonably.

Carney*: I'll second.

Carney*: all those in favor?

All*: Aye

Carney*: OK thank you. 3 -0 vote to deny the rehearing. The meeting is adjourned at 7:40pm.
