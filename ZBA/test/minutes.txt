Carney*: Itâ€™s time to call the ZBA to order at 7:01 pm before I go any further, I'm going to let Deb speak on the recording procedures. 

 DeFosse: I tried Microsoft 365 I purchased it personally just to test it out to see if I can recommend it to the town so with the new Microsoft 365 it dictating my minutes very quickly, sorry transcribed,  and so it wasn't a very long process before all that I have seen is one and I think you can correct this is when you speak you say your name even just the last name and then speak so this way if I'm not here and you're doing a recording and I got the tape I know who spoke so that's the only down last minute I've been working on is I had to think so other than that you know the product does repeat words like sometimes ZBA is not picked up as ZBA but for an hours' worth  making those corrections. I showed the selection and I thought it was worth the price. The selectmen authorized me to purchase it.

Carney:  I'd like to add that I really liked the last time we voted on the minutes it came out really well but Mark spent a whole lot of time doing it and I think this one here will be a lot better and much superior and I think it'll actually cut down on Debbie's time so I was totally in favor of doing this for a while at least you know trying to you know get things going. 

DeFosse:  You know like you said I can't hear certain things sometimes when I'm doing my minutes and so I just feel that we keep it the way it is we can add microphones to that so we microphones extends to them and to us so we can you know get clear messages to it so I think it will work. 

Carney*:  Thank you for speaking on the recording of our minutes.

Carney*: The members present tonight myself Gary Carney chairman, Mark Florence vice chairman, Linda Marshall and Andrew hatch is absent tonight, and our administrator assistant Deb DeFosse.  

Carney: we won't be approving the minutes of March 13th Deb still has some work to do on them they will be ready for the next meeting since Andrew is not here, we will wait until the next meeting for the election of chairman that will take place on the next meeting which I do not have my calendar out April 29th will be our next meeting, 

Florence*: April 26th will be our next meeting. I'm all set for that.

Florence:  Mr. chair I did have some comments to preference the meeting if I may lead directly up to our investigation on the motion so the first note that I made to myself was Mr. chair do you might recall that at the end of the last meeting we were approached by a selectman who suggested that it may not be appropriate for the chair to make a motion 

Carney*: That is correct.

Florence:  that was good advice intended to make these meetings more robust for so I did a little bit of investigating because I was curious about that. It turns out according to Roberts the chair does have the power to motion, but strongly advised not recommended.  For twelve member boards or more not recommended but three member boards its quite common. Again, it was it was it was well intended good advice that you know like I didn't want to ignore or anything like that so for the purpose of this meeting I leave it up to you of course you know to make your own decision about that my feeling is that because we're not bound by Roberts we're actually as our own rules of procedure that by what we do with these meetings what we might want to do in the future meeting. 

Florence: There is a strict 30 day time limit for the appeal to be made and I wanted to know for the record that the that the appeal coming before us that was made in a timely fashion so it's before us not to analyze however once I was reviewing the notice of decision that we issued last time I reminded myself that we issued a condition subsequent to that asking that as a condition of the this meeting here you know here hearing what am I trying to say meeting to discuss motions for rehearing that before that that the errors on page four and the emissions on Page Six of the permit application will be fixed and not only that but see over town but the second story should be made and in fact that was agreed I wrote to the minutes and that was agreed on but that would happen it hasn't happened and I want to point that out for the record that the board of course has no enforcement powers it's just you know the phase of all the projects that fee has not been paid and I just want to I think we can do about it now except note it and move on.  Another thing that I wanted to kind of our own all our own edification is that as I was doing some reading to prepare for this, I looked at RSA 677: 3 and then and it was interesting it was interesting to me and it kind of guided me of my thoughts it says that the motions that the issues raised in the in the motion are final and let me read just an extract from the RSA 

Quote*: A motion for rehearing shall set forth fully every ground upon which it is claimed that the decision or order complaint of excuse me complained of is unlawful or unreasonable no ground not set forth at the application shall be urged relied on or given any consideration and this is a good cause.

Florence*: Meaning they can't make any additional arguments without leave of the court as it moves forward. 

 Florence:  initially I thought that it might be as simple as taking a vote on the standard for our review I believe in this meeting is to answer two questions does the motion contain any new evidence or arguments to cause any consideration and did the board act unlawfully or unreasonably at the original hearing. I think it's what we have to look at tonight to satisfy ourselves whether we should grant or deny the motion for hearing.  doesn't make sense.
