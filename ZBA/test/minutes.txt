[09:36 am] Bob: Tell you basically what what this is about is when I was watching Harvey Mackay, that one of our backers things. He said he just finished the Boston Marathon and you know guys 76, I'm at holy crap, you know, this is amazing. He looks so fit and he's so quick minded and and so on I thought all the sudden it occurred to me that the way you eat do you know is different. I bet you don't just just eat a bunch of garbage and that started this thought. So the basic three questions will be and I'm recording it for use as well as if I transcribed these for the book, but then I write about it. And what's really been need about it? Is that what started out as three, same questions to everybody? Everybody had kind of a different angle on it. And I realize that they were creating the chapters for this book. And of course, Marci shimoff read me the ride accident where I did all the work and you're just transcribing it but if you actually right in the book I'll do it. So I made her that promise that it was a hard promise but it was a good one to make because it made me think more, you know. So what I would do is I am basically introduce you and then you can add anything that you think is important to that in her duck. And let me get my history up here because I have I have you on here? How's Robbie

I thought that was a really cool angle to because part of part of success is who you know and you know I think that's important. I don't know what your what Your angle is going to be on this, but the vision of the questions will be. Do you think that that hypothesis is true that, you know, the food affect your ability to succeed on some level and then if you

[09:39 am] Jim*: text you too early to

[09:39 am] Bob: know if it, if it plays into into your level of success, in other words, you know, I know they're there are successful people who eat crappy food but so far. The consensus has been its run the gamut of extremes, But but so far people seem to say, you know, they can't keep up their energy. If you speak a lot, you do a lot of speaking. So, You know, and you have a hectic schedule. So I imagine that if you're, you know, full of two pizzas, you probably don't have the energy on stage that you normally would.

[09:40 am] Jim*: So that's

[09:40 am] Bob*: that's kind of the angle.
