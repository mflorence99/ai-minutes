Carney*: Itâ€™s time to call the ZBA to order at 7:01 pm before I go any further, I'm going to let Deb speak on the recording procedures.

DeFosse+: <p>I personally purchased Microsoft 365 to test it out and see if it was worth recommending to the town. The dictation feature worked quickly, but there was one downside - it didn't always pick up names correctly. Overall, I found the product to be worth the price and the selectmen authorized me to purchase it.</p>

Carney+: <p>I really enjoyed the last time we voted on the minutes and thought it turned out well. However, Mark spent a lot of time on it. I believe this new method will be much better and save Debbie time. I have been in favor of trying this for a while to improve efficiency.</p>

DeFosse+: <p>I sometimes can't hear certain things when I'm doing my minutes, so I think we should keep it the way it is but add microphones to extend the reach of the sound. This way, we can get clear messages and I believe it will work.</p>

Carney*: Thank you for speaking on the recording of our minutes.

Carney*: The members present tonight myself Gary Carney chairman, Mark Florence vice chairman, Linda Marshall and Andrew hatch is absent tonight, and our administrator assistant Deb DeFosse.

Carney+: <p>I won't be approving the minutes of March 13th because Deb still has some work to do on them. They will be ready for the next meeting. Since Andrew is not here, we will wait until the next meeting for the election of chairman. The next meeting is on April 29th, but I don't have my calendar out.</p>

Florence*: April 26th will be our next meeting. I'm all set for that.

Florence+: <p>I have some comments to make regarding the meeting. I would like to start with our investigation on the motion. I noted that at the end of the last meeting, a selectman suggested that it may not be appropriate for the chair to make a motion.</p>

Carney*: That is correct.

Florence+: <p>I received good advice about making meetings more robust and decided to investigate further. I found out that according to Roberts, the chair has the power to motion but it is strongly advised against for larger boards. However, it is common for three member boards. I didn't want to ignore the advice, but ultimately left the decision up to the group since we have our own rules of procedure.</p>

Florence+: <p>I need to confirm that the appeal was filed within the 30 day time limit. I also need to bring attention to the fact that errors in the permit application have not been fixed, despite it being agreed upon in a previous meeting. Unfortunately, the board has no enforcement powers in this matter. Additionally, I found RSA 677:3 to be interesting as it states that issues raised in a motion are final.</p>

Quote*: A motion for rehearing shall set forth fully every ground upon which it is claimed that the decision or order complaint of excuse me complained of is unlawful or unreasonable no ground not set forth at the application shall be urged relied on or given any consideration and this is a good cause.

Florence*: Meaning they can't make any additional arguments without leave of the court as it moves forward.

Florence+: <p>I initially believed that we could simply vote on the standard for our review during this meeting. I think the main questions we need to answer tonight are whether the motion presents any new evidence or arguments and whether the board acted unlawfully or unreasonably during the original hearing. This is what we need to consider in order to decide whether to grant or deny the motion for a hearing.</p>
