No I think it's all signed and sealed right he's taken the oath of office the select board of agreed to appoint him and it's just a question of B sadly he couldn't be but president Andrew hatch Linda Marshall Gary Carney Dr. fauci and me mark Florence 

so the first order of business is to approve the minutes we got a backlog of minutes that we need to approve and the suggests we have 4 separately on each of them so hopefully we've all read the minutes of the March 13th meeting that was the cruiser let me make a motion that we approve those minutes I'll second all those in favor aye so that's what caused unanimously the March 27th hearing that was the minch hearing I hope we've all seen those minutes as well make a motion to approve second all those in favor 

I don't think you have to you see this so all right we also have the minister that April 26th which which wasn't a public hearing where we decided several things we didn't vote for the chairman and vice chair and so on that circulated those minutes today 

I make a motion that we accept those minutes do I have a second second all those yeah um 

next on the list is unfinished business and the big issue topic issue actually it's just an issue of the rules of procedure that we studied at our last meeting at the April 26th meeting and according to the ovals we have to follow the ovals before we have new rules they have to be read in on two consecutive meetings before the meeting that they that they got so we have to we can we can move into to items right but we have to read them and then if everything is OK we will approve them on our June meeting that sounds good so I make a motion that the rules that procedure as well right now and that we will look at them again secondary OK so that's done so no just be a formality that in June we'll vote to accept them and we will vote on it you will vote no we'll be able to vote on it and then the restriction that any changes have to wait for this two consecutive meetings etcetera etcetera we're supposed to be saying our names before we talk or maybe that's a good segue into

 the second part of the unfinished business that I mentioned I think before anything OK I was working on the software that I've been working on the software that we were talking about last week last month and now with the software does do the speech recognition for transcription the speaker ID and the time stamps and I'm going to use this recording today as a test if that's so I will take that away and and and do the transcription and and my tests if you tell it there are four speakers there's gonna be 6 tonight 6 tonight then it makes a pretty good effort to figure out you know it must be some parameters and what the parameters are but it knows the 6:00 so it will divide up it does a pretty good job of recognizing speakers maybe there's an I in there that what's wrong so the short answer to you Gary it's like we're gonna forget just gonna forget about this is gonna forget that OK so we'll just that's not 
 
 his is your chance to speak but I do want to put something on the table right away before you get started so we don't go down the rabbit hole of some measurement issues that I found I actually was working with Gary that we paired up with some measurements so I think you do address those first if you could and then and then and then talk about what you're talking about having processor I give this to you here's my opinion yeah if you want to come up here so imagine all of this that's three weeks ago we did something and then week ago I did some measuring as well to double check it and it didn't all that so yeah like you address that if you could 
 
 you don't have the dimensions for some reason on my original just here I don't have this is the diagram that you submitted back in right and that's what we use to to guide us but she that I just gave you is what we've actually measured and certainly appreciate any input from the other board members as they did their own measurements the sheep I guess that's my biggest yeah 21 1/2 by 14 what what are the parameters use that includes the the you have the check yeah but then you have an overhang coming towards the house and then attached to the back of the shed well it's a it's a depth so when you when you measure the whole thing out you now come out with the 21 1/2 by 14 yeah so 
 
 I remember quite a long time ago couple years ago when we did this I asked about the coverage because it wasn't I didn't find it that clear and I apologize I did not expect this is referencing tonight so I didn't go back and look at anything I remember asking like didn't ask about the shed I asked about the new garage because we have that approach overhang on it and at that time that's why the garage that we the new garage would put the measurements are the garage measurements not including that approach overhang because it didn't have walls it wasn't at the time we didn't create or anything under but we were told that the measurements wall to wall was bang it will this make sure they're in agreement from everybody that overhangs part of the structure if that's what power is measured and that's when I I just remember years back asking for that asking that question and I believe I remember three you guys on board but it was a couple others here I believe it was one of the original measurement one of my neighbors you may know I'm referring to Don Valley Rd. is the one that told me measure the walls so that's why these measurements are different you know this is just just the wall areas that that I measured so I did not measure the overhang on the original shed or or that or I mentioned the deck mouse but I do see that I do not see it in terms of the square footage that was presented in the original application that showed that so I assume that I measured it but I guess I don't yeah OK so it wasn't measured in the original language compliance OK and and in that regard I have no if my measurements were wrong they just didn't include the overhang and the deck areas that would have been insert interpretation of buildings on my part to where I simply interpreted it wrong I understand reason why significant trip but I was over anyways so we needed that original variance so it wouldn't have done me any good too at the time to not measure them if I knew or realize that they should have measured I was over no matter how you measure it I guess what I'm saying is it didn't didn't work my advantage to cut that out the current application is 29% color and that the removal of the shape will get you below the 10% and that that's from the from those original measurements that I took that are different than the I I kind of wish that we had it's not your job to do that it's mine I kind of wish that we had this these measurements based on those overhang areas prior to the original permit being issued you know what I mean that would have had a much different feeling and opinion here on the deck I did not realize there were 15% coverage and and that's significant because removing the shadow is not gonna make you perform well so you guys were out there if we took these aside for a minute and just these are clearly at 50% just put that off to the side for for a minute a couple of the things the reason that the shed has become an issue is we were those were originally two separate lots we all know that and what I wrote I was highly encouraged to combine the two lots that's what the town wanted that's the town doesn't like the small lots went through the pros of it in the meeting through the concrete in the meeting and quite honestly the pros were more in favor of you know what the communities it didn't matter to me it didn't matter at all right so we combined the two lots had I not done that had I not done that we want to even had to go through the original variance because my my coverage on the lot would have been grandfather or whatever the appropriate word is and then my garage building that I just built doesn't exceed the coverage on that lot so that lot stand alone with a garage on it my old lot with the the house and the shed on it which exceeded if you're building a new but they would have been and that was one of the one of the things we talked about at that meeting several years ago so that led me to now which is two of my neighbors behind me I have no problems with any neighbors have no problems with what they've done with the properties no problems with what they had to do the one right to the back the greenhouse where their driveway goes out onto valley Rd. 
 
 When they put in that new septic system and the second no no problems are on the other the probes are behind the others yeah I think it is when they put in that leach field and septic system and they cut all those trees if you saw in the pictures or if you guys are there my backyard in their backyard completely open to each other completely open and without the shed there both of us lose any sort of privacy from the RT yard and I just felt like at the time I really think about it because the show was there and now with the removal of the shed kind of gonna sound funny it's not intended to our bathroom and their bathroom literally face each other it just got a little thing the other day and it was my wife was they say Oh my God we're looking at that so the reason I'm asking for the shed to stay is primarily for that privacy if you look at my lot right now there's a trailer parked on my lot if you look at my lot and you guys have all been down there I think I don't think you'd be telling the truth if you said it wasn't clean neat and tight I don't have equipment outside I don't have trailers all over the place and that sort of thing in the neighborhood I think that's we all kind of like we all like it that way there's several residences and structures on the way in the lake that can't make that claim and nobody wants to live next to to that look nobody wants to no nobody wants that as their neighbor and and and affecting their own value or anything of the sort I think that we've done a really good job of keeping our lot well spread well separated very clean the shed originally yes that can go that can go when there was a good tree bearing there which no longer exists and we've we've discovered some other things quite honestly we like coming up here a lot more than and that we have a black grandchildren not like someone up here and so we've inherited much like everybody else in that area we've inherited a few toys would it be a jet ski or snowmobile or snow blowers and lawn mowers and it would be nice to be able to keep them in in the shed that is significant and that does make it a different conversation the deck off the back of that shed the deck off the back I don't even I don't need it I don't use it it serves no purpose previous owners built it I think right now I have an old snow blower there in a kayak both of which don't need to be there I would be very very willing to remove that deck and also they overhang off that shed we don't even like that overhang we don't need it anymore we never really needed it it'd be very simple to remove that and I would be more than amenable to removing those two you know because at the difference on that on the shed the difference on the shed is you know significant my original measurements are 12 by 10 and 120 square feet and the actual measurements that you guys have the overhang of debt 303 that that's a very big piece I would be more than happy to remove those two things they don't need to be there quite honestly they are the two oldest scrappiest junkiest crappiest features of our product we obviously would still be over but those two things don't serve effort they don't serve privacy purpose they don't serve planners so I'd be very willing to ensure or you know get rid of those two things
 
  OK so accepting that sort and and and putting it for a second when was the garage completed um well there's still a few I mean the graduates completed I don't know if I don't know 
  
  I don't know how to actually answer that question with you know there's still a few things that need to be done for the garage but the actual garage as far as it being completed and the structure up and wrapped would have been the spring of 2022 just about a year ago just just about a year ago let's say May 2022 
  
  I would think that would be fair that was the one with the cuts down the two cuts much prior to that they were they were done they were actually done prior to us building prior to the garage going up after I don't know I'd have to ask when that was done but that was after we had started our planning and started things that those with that they actually had to take another one down just recently recently I think was in the fall it wasn't as big but it was closer you know if you saw there was a fresh cut stuff right behind that deck that you guys were on 
  
  so are are you saying that those trees were taken down prior to the December meeting when you came before the board and applied for a variance 
  
  I won't bet my life on it but it was all within a pretty close time frame there I wouldn't bet my life on it but I would say that if they weren't down or if they were down we hadn't even realized or you know we're not up that often that time here we're not you know I want to I would have more of a problem the privacy issue if I was aware of my wife and I were aware of I don't remember the timing of when they didn't they cut a whole bunch of trees and did a whole bunch of work and put the septic I think the leach field in and we came up one time had been here for a while came up one time and the whole backside of house was like whoa that's open and then when we came up a little bit you know quite some time after that they've got a few so I don't know the timing of all that 
  
  I was gonna say I don't remember when we went to measure that with an old cottage state that the structure that was there I don't I don't remember anything looking around and seeing anything fresh cut I do remember what between the the cottage in the street wasn't there a whole bunch of stuff that you had to get out of there and no there wasn't there wasn't rocks
  
  
  
  Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah there was trees around my property yes yes yes there was that was you know close to the road there was a bunch of big boulders and then further away there's where the old cottage was was a big bold and we clean that up but yeah obviously you did 
  
  I'm thinking back on that time and I remember it was December so I went out there and I can remember take taking measurements but I remember having a hard time getting out of there and for the for the life of me I couldn't remember there was there was something between the garage and the street but I don't remember what it was and you just clarified it and I do remember it 
  
  Fred's project that he had done down in back that was cut after I'm pretty sure I was right on the same thing all three of those things our project Fred crombies and the neighbors good director some of those some of the 
  
  some of those things that if you could go back and do things differently of course but when you're you know when we're trying to get a project through I can't say is that we were thinking clearly of you know every aspect we want to delay this project any longer over a shed that at the time it wasn't that important to us I do have it it hasn't little to do with this board but I I do have I recently have gotten gotten my tax bills and for some reason the town is still recognizing that as two separate lots and still taxing me accordingly 
  
  you have to talk the assessors about that yeah but that's that that was that's something that was just that the merger had been done and merger had been done had been done for some reason the assessors are still not I did this I did tell her about it oh I have same problem last year yeah and I talked to her so that's just the phone call number on the subject 
  
  I was I was at your place last Wednesday and I took a couple of photographs unfortunately I didn't bring my computer when I got one I got the money so I'd like to I'd like to us to take a look at this and and I've got the classes around 
  
  if I may did you all get these pictures no I didn't get any there was one e-mail sent two separate emails and one one was to the planning board and one was student everything just the day before I fill out the bearings OK so may not May 9th but they just show and I don't mean to interrupt you no I 
  
  if you were out at the house you can when you're standing in the driveway looking you can't even see this yet like my camera went that much but because this was last week lease coverage yeah because what I'm trying to show yeah is that and what I'm looking at here is at that cut that we don't treat he's cut down the big trees right and you can see that it was not obscure no from where from where you're standing there from where you're standing there where is behind this it's pretty decent so it's a pretty decent treatment interesting show otherwise no it's it's not a very a real decent coverage there of course this is taken before the foliage come out yeah whenever yeah so like without this we're standing on the corner of my head you can see yeah yes that's right you are all the way to that side of the deck and so you have the let's say the maximum amount of you of that slot and Without the shedding you free back over here with some of the growth that's there now doesn't look all that bad but without this is basically the same exact angle 
  
  
  I'm also on the deck without that growth in the 6-7 months out of the year if you're on deck and you come back there you're looking right at it OK just take a look at I actually these neighbors they're up quite a bit but they weren't up this weekend I would want to go over and talk to them and ask them for a letter but I didn't get a chance to do that OK 
  
  I'm looking at the other photograph that I took which is looking at that's the evidence right this is looking over the crimes crimes which is to the north which is against the shadow the shadow shadows not factor and that was a pretty decent treatment they have hard time making up the conversation one again I just sent these three of them when you're coming this way that you guys originally went up there and you had to do 4 wheel drive of your feet that was very thick behind the garage that thickness is gone so looking to the promise again with the foliage isn't standing on the back deck looking this way around the back it's opened up pretty good you can I can sit on my deck and when traffic goes by with a buddy of mine goes by they they see me that way yeah yeah listen this isn't a thing that I am standing here saying this should needs to be there it's going to ruin my life and and create hardships there is a hardship that I see is going to develop with our neighbors there I don't get along with my neighbors very well they're great people I think like 9 and our kids do a good job staying private but we have different interests and I think there's a pretty good opportunity without some blockage I don't own enough there's not enough evaluate sure sure sure I put that up to including the property line II just trying to understand but again it's the shed the privacy is another one thing I also don't want any trailers in my garden what's in the shed well it's everything can go my rage but then I lose the the rage I have trailer tow behind trailer my lawn mowers those sort of thing even though she has a big footprint it's not very big inside in the in the in the shade yeah no it's it's it's it's it's it's big enough to store about this it's big enough to store a lot of things our cottage our house I think western mass it's we're more rural than you guys are everybody up here that's been in my house and waiting last why you watching has become a great place because the house is small it's a cottage and it's become a great place where we can have cookouts we get another rain we can you know have family and get togethers and everybody has a little piece of the garage is dart boards over there my TV's over here so we didn't expect that and we built the garage 
  
  
  quite honestly and one of the things we should point out don't know if it's been 20 about the concept of hardship and perspective and he's pretty good so you're continuing to refer to hardship being an inconvenience for you no I don't use the word hardship once in this conversation and I didn't use it as a hardship what's that so in the application it asks for a hardship one of the five criteria is to show a hardship and today my reference the hardship it wasn't a hardship that is current on my part it's a hardship that I'm fearing is going to develop with the name with with openness but again unfortunately don't through labor upon the words and the usage of the term hardship you were showing us their misunderstanding is that why because it's a tough thing for people to get their head around that is purely and simply that notion that the unique nature of your law creates an unreasonable hardship for you the property owner can do something because it is unique and different from from others it has nothing to do with the potential to see concept of a hardship for relationship or anything like that when I read that only hardship to the property not the owner can be considered for example unnecessary hardship might be imposed on a small significant amount of leads requires that experience that's it's not hardship on it I'm not the hardship to what you were saying to us is that you're you're in the openness of your property without the shedding away is in somehow going to in your view predicting hardship in the future between you and your neighbor what you just 
  
  said and I'm just pointing out that that has no bearing on what we're doing tonight are you trying to ascertain tonight is if there's anything you need and my colleague presented this tonight and I agreement this is the calculations here and I'm glad that you have seen fit too are we talking about the removal of the schedule in the current agreement actually reduce the total square footage of structures only going to thirteen 8.8% that's correct that's that's that enough or that would make the difference between staying in compliance but otherwise it's not that would be clear everyone's losing sight of a discussion that has more relevance have the accounting of the actual square foot been accurate but that's not the case so I'm not sure that we're hearing the case in the right just make sure that we're clear as to given that these have been accepted by this thing that we are we still moving forward with the same application or what are we doing right now the the application was for a variance on a 21.5 which is building coverage so strictly Mr. bean your application says that with the schedule remaining in place to allow a building coverage of 10.9 so in that sense in that sense this application if it were to go forward we'd have to modify right we would have to say to allow the building coverage to be 13.8 one 13.8% 
  
  I believe roughly agreeing with Mr. bean believe he's I believe Harlan if I'm correct when you came and spoke with the selectman you talked to them because you wanted to come here in front of this board to appeal the other boy's decision remove and not have the shed removed I think you were just you were trying to appeal in reversed this decision yes because this is next 30 day limit on the appeal of the decision you wouldn't be able to do that OK So what was the decision has been made and I think it was made January or January 2021 or late December 2020 you would have had 30 days from then to appeal that decision so I think 30 days from the completion of the building just because it was the agreement was when the building was completed the shed had to be yeah but the agreement was called the agreement it's from an agreement was made not from when some condition on the agreement was dependent on so you had but I can clearly see you just want to say this 
  
  I can clearly see what you guys are the zoning board adjustments your explanation of things and your detail and knowledge of what you're dealing with is quite and a few other rewards simply we would like to keep the shed and there has to be a mechanism for us to appeal and try to keep that shed without running continuing to run into well this is a CDA issue this is a planning board issue this is you missed your 30 days I mean common sense as I said to the select I I can park myself outside I can leave that 7 foot by 20 foot long trailer outside and I can leave my other trailer that is I just removed to my buddies house the other day outside and being cautious I don't want you to think that I was in insinuating hardship wasn't I can leave those things outside it's not that is not hard it just doesn't look good 
  
  I'm skeptical that what if whatever fits in that 120 square feet inside space in shape it's going to be so much space and I think everything 155th square feet so 
  
  I'm 100 square foot those previous outside so it's still like moving around right now and that the right that shed is unlocked I don't really want that you could just take up like this and look in there and you will see what's in there and you will see it is quite significant there's a trailer there's one more there's towards cabinets there's lumber there's there's quite a bit there but that's not the issue because that's a hardship for me and it's not that I want the common sense of why do I have to put a crappy looking trailer to accomplish what I want to do I don't want the trailer there I want stuff in the garage in the shed I don't feel at home so I can enjoy my big yard I probably the biggest open yard piece of grass on valley Rd. from one end to the other got it surprises me that I'm over on the coverage numbers going live my life's not that big but I'm not like many many many many many people who are rightfully cramming trailers and tractors and hoop sheds and all these other things on their property I don't want that I want the property nice my neighbors want my property as the neighbors that I have they're all they think this looks great I don't want that's a great thin. I wish I wish I wish we had talked a week ago just you know conversation because I would love for you to come up the first thing I do when I get to when I get to our place when we're out here for a week from the weekend the first thing I do open both garage doors the tractor comes out it's my neighbors tractor because he lost his food and he's got so much so we have the tracker clear the tractor comes out that can start over behind the trailer and then everything get moved just so we can enjoy the garage have a place shape out of the rain that sort of thing in that ship in the in my trailers my snowmobiles and few other things if I have to I have to remove the ship there's something have to go away or go somewhere they'll probably get parked outside which is more unsightly than the damn trailer and what's in the shed is a lot of things that can't get wet and shouldn't get wet so those will go on the trip I'm not trying to tell you hey listen I can put 10 trails there's nothing you can do about it so if you want remove the show I'll remove the shed and buy three more trails I'm not using that as a chip against the town I'm just saying it doesn't make sense to me to have a nice piece of property that's open and accomplishes some privacy and accomplishes some rules that I think I think honestly the talent regardless of this likes I think you would rather see 20% coverage if it's done in a nice way that keeps things clean and and good for the neighborhood and good for property values and everything I think I know you would rather see that I'm oh didn't I was actually kinda little but removing the shipping do I think I can do it there's no problems but I have to do some other things to take away and I do I know that in any public private or anywhere you're almost under communism you're almost using some ignorance when you assume or predict a battle in the future or when you say there's going potentially could be a hardship we are actually that people should do that but we're all smart enough to know in our heads that's probably what's going to happen 
  
  we can't just thought I was trying to help you no I'm not arguing but I'll be pleased you're here for the kids with our own kind quite precious going round in circles on irrelevancies is not a good use of my time and it certainly won't improve my predisposition 
  
  I apologize thank you as I was trying this out from my colleagues were actually here tonight candies Michael can't do tonight anything materially get introduced into this meeting during this discovery making material difference that we continue this or are we in a position to make sort of some form of government tonight that's the question I believe 
  
  I didn't see that OK so I just wanted to put it out to the chance to and see whether we're you that's a good point and I want to circle back though just quickly to issue the debates about the appeal that that that you could have made appeal though unfortunately it's way beyond time to do that thing that you might might have explored your best option which was to ask for a variance to keep the show whether or not we're in position to run that we'll see I don't know what other tool would have been disposed because the equitable waiver right equitable waiver possibly possibly you know one of the things that we can't do you mentioned you wish you could have spoken to us a week ago one of the things we can't do is offer advice OK but we the only thing we can do is we can to us make an application for right or whatever and we have to duplicate that that's all we can do you might you might applications of variance does anyone else have any questions for Mr. 
  
  people no I have a question well maybe I should wait until we go on a little further OK OK I'll say I'll is is this really what he wants to do is is it really up to us to do this we've already voted on this thing two years ago three years ago I mean is it beyond our limitations to change things now I think it might be and we can explore that as we deliver it I'm not saying it is but I think we should think about that for a second yeah I I I had forgot about 30 days but I I was thinking about this today as I was pondering coming here tonight and I said to myself cheers you know I forgot about the 30 day part but I I thought in the back of my mind I said you know once the hammer gets put down and everybody agrees on the outcome in fact that was what I was going to be bringing up please because you know again a little bit different but we have something else that's floating around about an agreement that was made in the past and that and then it wants to change and 
  
  let's get into that as we deliver OK that's what I thought that would go thank you make sure that Mister second March say in that regard 
  
  my only comment is my butters have changed the parameters of their property That have changed the setting you see of the shedding we're on recent right you have a place up here around the fences around us but I if I was in your shoes I'd be I'd ask that same question you just asked you know decisions are made and decisions are made with the gavel be fine but there are circumstances I'm not saying this one that's you guys say but there are circumstances that change from time to time that need to be taken into consideration sometimes sense but when you walk away from here tonight whatever the outcome you will have 30 days from tonight to appeal whatever we decide if we choose to do that I wanna appeal your decision I'm not you know that we wanted to leave the shed there I'm not chasing advantage for something whatever your decision is I will not appeal it just I'd like to do some talk yourself into because if you're absolutely right and we won't be offended I understand what you guys what you're tasked with here and I think you understand what what what we're trying to accomplish OK I have so many people that say well just check it out for next on register just did anything I don't need anything anyone anything like wait is my neighbors no I'm also I'm I'm I'm is there anything else you want to say I think if I kept talking about doing it disservice to myself I choose silence so at 
  
  7:49 I move to close the public hearing do I have a second I'll second all those in favor aye that passes unanimously so this would be the public hearing and then we go into deliberation and you have the absolute right to listen to everything that you said the only thing that we can do after discussion comment so 
  
  I'm enjoying myself so I'll sit here like so so 
  
  I'll get the ball rolling this is I I see four modems unfortunately with the application and two of them very much related to the issue Gary Wilson I know so the first problem is that there was an agreement on January 5th I believe this is the agreement that that's got open January 1st between board of select and this would be to give him the building permit conditional on the shipping removed and I don't believe it's within our power there's one our authority is aboard to void an agreement that has been made between the side very much 
  
  I was I was going to bring up that same thing I guess I probably should have waited we went into deliberations everything I said before I think that sort of applies here the experience it's not decision to make I don't know what other recourse is available but that's that's my first that it's not our decision and my second thought again I think you touched on it that 
  
  there's a well established well established move there's only word that we basically can't hear the same application twice but if you come to us with an applicant comes to us with a variance that it has to be. Different than american their application that came before i looked it up before this afternoon and this is big fisher versus bell case we're back in 1980 and what it says are we know successive variance proposals must demonstrate either one material changes in the proposed use of the land or two material changes in the circumstances circumstances affecting the merits of the application and by those standards a second sort it wasn't because keyboard as already heard this and we don't have any ability to doing some different appreciate anybody else's thoughts on please do think actually we've got some sort of cascading logic here and I think that's the other objective point who is that 8 to 8 that's it to ask for a variance upon something that's already been approved in the post is is not is not what we do we we are responsible for making that decision only certain case and then to make sure that the work was performed in the wind was put in basically on the plans of the in this case the shape was remove those two forms in the case so the first one material changes in the proposed use of land I think that's all the proposed use of the land is identical now as it was back in January 21 changes in circumstances affecting the merits of the argument could be made into protective yeah material material changes in circumstances 
  
  I move on that I'd say that just his to statement this would make that could be made and that certainly you know I wanted to all four of these reasons because it's been said tonight that's good and anybody reading that we could also but number one was overtime supposing of course you have I'm sorry which is this is a duplicate application so wasn't the overall debt right now sorry I said the material discrepancies in the accounting and that the the basis of the application is that removal of the shed would have made the left before and so and then unfollow I just thinking you know I don't have time to expand on that because number 123 but pretty pretty heavyweight but supposing supposing this was completely done 
  
  right that we were sitting here right now we were hearing this how are you I would go on the public interest in the spirit of the annual or substantial injustice or dilution of property boundaries or unnecessary hardship and again you were going down a bit on that right is just getting more to us right special circumstances special conditions and this is unnecessary and it's nothing like that we would reject the application of this merits even once yeah 
  
  I'm taking it I think you already signed it the fact that we consider this to be appropriate that's the only one I'm a little confused but it doesn't make sense for us to be OK this or not to go back to the select that's one evidence and I suppose opening that door that would that be shipping back to the selected I mean I don't go too far down that house because it's not our business and I don't know what the avenues are what we're saying here is that agreements made between listening and select word and that's the decision of this removal of the garage was CBA and then the selectman signed off on that as the condition of building that garage doing listening to CBA so he they actually acknowledged yes we agree with CBA we will sign off on the CBA's decision of removing the the shed once that garage was built like Don had spoken with Harlan and he told them that they could not do it and that's why the selectman sent them to you guys just want clarification I'm not putting in an opinion I'm just clarifying what was said when he met with the select board information 
  
  I the reason I do 1234 is that supposedly what backs it up I'm having my hat on number one I say yes the the jungle did make the decision and then the selectman issued a permit for construction dependent with that same condition yeah so now that that agreement is in the hands of the select that's that's that's that's my position that's what I'm trying to say yeah and all I remember during that conversation was Donovan just saying that I cannot remove that cause that's a condition of us giving you that garage and that's when he brought him here that's us the permit to build a garage based on the fact that the shed would be correct based off of that was the only Z BA decision that was made it was that CBA that made that decision and then when it went to the front of the selectman they saw OK CBA made a decision and we agree with that decision this CBA made so I don't know I'm just saying for on behalf of Harlem because he can't speak I was there at the meeting so I just wanted to say what that was what happened at the selectman's office and and Yep that's what information is need more search what what what what saying that I 
  
  I do want to spend a few minutes just two things two things have to do and I did prepare for and the other I did do a little bit of appointment on what we did 2 1/2 years ago and I would like I would like to discuss that anybody going to 1st I'd like to I think it was just right here Andrew and I were on that board I I believe Bruce Carpenter was a chair and ralphie was and the elderly gentleman Jack jacks on the board what a memory yeah yeah what was your preference thank you I that's one the lottery 2544311 applies when you're expanding before that that's that's why that's why one because the the rear of the garage is 24 feet away from the from the laundry room and it should be 25 in my opinion that drones probably wasn't needed because on the original footprint it was 2014 so if it was all done on the original problem maybe they're variance wasn't needed I think I think the original one was 2025 feet and then they needed an extra foot to put the garage at Oh no oh oh oh I have it here that must have been my fault I didn't we didn't see the red button I didn't see yeah that's OK that's OK Yep Yep thank you no problem so so we needed it or a foot was needed to build the garage so therefore you went from the 25 to 24 and that's where you needed you didn't need that one foot variance if you were on the same foot you could be two inches away from the back from the it was asking for a foot more it was asking for a foot more it was asking for a footnote when I was looking at this that the existing cottage is 24 feet away from the from the red light So what I'm saying and and and because that's that never moved it was on the you know it's wouldn't make any difference there's where there's where I made a mistake tough measuring it and I thought we were doing the 1 foot and I think the variance from 43.2 which because because that's that's that's what says you have to put on something and it wasn't built and so that and then and then two or two the front set back in the garage it's only 36 feet from the from the row that damages so got measured not not thinking about the overhang the overhang because when it when it did that it it came right in almost and then basically yeah it was something like and thank you just for the right Mr. we missed a bunch of hey is there a comment on that like I didn't mean it to be you know I just need to be clear about what variances are needed and wanted to wanted to put that on Michael so I'm preparing documentation and I'm I'm ready to make that unless anybody else has this also OK so I'll I'll return this but because I'm gonna be preparing the transcribing minutes anyway I've got it down so this is what I want to do 
  
  I move that the various applications submitted by Holland B be denied for the following four reasons one board does not have authority to avoid the permit for construction going by the select board on January 7th 2021 two the current application does not demonstrate your changes from the original November 4th 2020 application and this is the proposed use of the land or the circumstances affecting his marriage 3 the applicants claim that remove over to coverage to coverage to an informal affair and then four on his merits to the recent state of department which settles in the notice of decision there's one motion go ahead second that motion I'll second all those in favour aye aye Alright so that concludes the deliberative session the meeting at 8:07 you have is there any new business do we have any uh do we have any more cases coming up for next month not at this time OK all things being equal our next meeting is June 28th 2027 and what whether we whether we have cases or not we should have the meeting because we want to take care of that we have to take a vote on that other issue from before that is you know and maybe maybe if we have any kind of workshop type of things schedule for that day cool yeah I have a question but not here you can ask that I'm only secretary but I'll try OK one it's a shame I didn't think it should come here either but this like we made it as you know extremely clear that they had they didn't touch it they didn't want to listen to it they didn't needed to come get needed to come here and whatever this ruling was was fine correct so that's why I came here now #2 what kind of time frame do I have to move it that's one thing for these guys that's totally up to the select board I'll give you till number may your building permit already expired in January this year yeah so they gave you a few weeks and then they gave you until the decision for this evening so tomorrow no no I meant tomorrow the selectman but I just wanna I just want you to know yeah I don't take your time but no that was very frustrated at this like board meeting I did not he had no reason to get hot with me than that selection did and he was very firm that they were going to make any sort so that kind of these guys did a great job for what they were tasked with that whole system board supposed to do so So what I do is I bring it back to the board tomorrow and I'll let them loan for looking for a time frame yeah and then we can I'll soon as they give me that I can call you 30 days would be OK OK I will bring this to them tomorrow and then I'll give you a call that's up to them they should be more aware of the power that they have when they sign and authorize on that they also have some double deliberation powers to deal with that it just doesn't get back here excused thank you very much appreciate it move to pull up this hold on yeah what happened with our recording whatever recording so I don't know why it's going out then I don't know if the battery needs to be recharged but it shouldn't be maybe maybe maybe it was maybe I wasn't so clumsy yeah it's not OK so it might charge it's runs on batteries so OK yeah I have it all here unfortunately it's reversed so everything that was spoken of today was dictating at the same time and there's audio file behind it is that right no all this is going is going to be fast go when you're talking it's typing because garry's over here he goes hold on there yeah the whole thing OK you can delete that you know is it because I was looking out of the corner so it it doesn't it there's no audio file to that so I won't be able to totally test myself for that but take a shot I'll take a shot at that it's weird how that's did that low battery OK Yep that's why OK alright so we need to for 12 I moved at this meeting this agenda aye it's not i just sent
