    <h1>Bean Application for a Variance</h1>

    <h2>Summary of Proceedings</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        The Washington Zoning Board of Adjustment meeting is called to order
        with several members present
      </li>
      <li>Backlog of minutes are approved unanimously</li>
      <li>
        The second reading of the amended Rules of Procedure is accepted as
        written
      </li>
      <li>
        Harlan Bean presents his case for a variance application, but there are
        measurement discrepancies
      </li>
      <li>
        Bean requests to keep the shed for storage purposes, but is willing to
        remove the deck and overhang
      </li>
      <li>
        Questions are asked about the completion of the garage and the timing of
        tree cutting on neighboring lots
      </li>
      <li>
        Bean believes it's fair that trees were taken down before building the
        garage, but is not sure when it happened
      </li>
      <li>
        Bean is concerned about privacy with his neighbors and wants to keep a
        shed for storage and family get-togethers
      </li>
      <li>
        Hatch clarifies that only a hardship arising from the property itself
        can be considered for granting a variance
      </li>
      <li>
        Florence took photographs of the property and is skeptical that the shed
        is causing a hardship
      </li>
      <li>
        Bean wants to keep his property clean and good for the neighborhood and
        property values, but is willing to remove the shed if necessary
      </li>
      <li>The discussion is centered around an application for a variance</li>
      <li>
        Some members of the board believe that the application should not be
        considered due to previous decisions and principles established in past
        cases
      </li>
      <li>
        There are also concerns about the accuracy of measurements and the lack
        of demonstrated special conditions or unnecessary hardship
      </li>
      <li>
        The board discusses what should have happened at the original hearing
        and the correct setbacks that should have been considered
      </li>
      <li>
        A variance from LUO 201.5 was required due to the size of the new garage
      </li>
      <li>
        Florence moves that the variance application submitted by Harlan and
        Marie Bean be denied for four reasons
      </li>
      <li>Marshall seconds the motion</li>
      <li>The motion is passed and the application for a variance is denied</li>
      <li>
        The meeting is adjourned and the next scheduled meeting will be on June
        28, 2023
      </li>

          Mr Bean, it's now your turn to present your case for your variance
          application. But before you do, I'd like you to address some
          measurement discrepancies Board member Carney and I discovered during
          our site visit to your lot. [Florence circulates a document detailing
          differences between claimed and observed measurements of house,

          I remember a few years ago when we were discussing coverage for our
          garage, I asked about the overhang and was told that the measurements
          were wall to wall. I didn't measure the overhang on the original shed
          or deck, and it wasn't included in the original application. Removing
          the shed would bring us below the 10% coverage limit, but I didn't
          realize the lot had 15% coverage. Combining the two lots led to the
          need for the original variance, and if we hadn't combined them, we
          wouldn't have exceeded the coverage limit. I have no issues with my
          neighbors' properties.

          I think that the removal of the shed has made my backyard and my

          our privacy. My request for the shed to stay is primarily for that
          reason. I have kept my lot clean and neat, and I don't have equipment
          outside like trailers and such. The shed is significant because it
          would allow me to store my inherited toys like a jet ski, snowmobile,
          snow blower, and lawn mower. I am willing to remove the deck off the
          back of the shed and the overhang because they don't serve any
          purpose.

          I see four problems with the application, the first two related to the
          issue raised by Carney. The first is that there was an agreement made
          on January 7, 2021 between Mr Bean and the Select Board in the form of
          a permit for construction that required, as a condition subsequent,
          that the shed by demolished. I don't believe we have the authority to
          void that agreement.

          The second problem I see is that there is a well-established principle
          that the Board can't hear the same application twice. Under Fisher v.
          Dover, it was established back in 1980 that "successive variance
          proposals must demonstrate either (1) material changes in the proposed
          use of the land or (2) material changes in the circumstances affecting
          the merits of the application." I don't believe that Mr Bean has
          demonstrated either requirement.

          My third objection is that the measurement discrepancies, not disputed
          by Mr Bean, undercut the foundation of the application to such an
          extent that we must deny it, nothwithstanding my earlier problems that
          suggest we can't hear it in the first place. Building coverage of the
          lot is not 10.9%, as claimed in the application, but in fact 15.81%.

          removal of the shed, they did so as a consequence of the ZBA's
          decision. Also, when Mr Bean recently met with the Select Board to
          discuss if that condition could be removed, it was the selectmen who
          advised Mr Bean to request a variance from the ZBA.

          I'd like to spend a minute covering what I believe should have
          happened at the original hearing. First, the rear setback variance
          should have been from LUO 403.1, not 202. When a building is being
          altered or expanded, a setback of only 25' is required. The Board
          clearly understood this, as the actual setback of the old cottage was
          24', so a variance of 1' was requested (and granted.) We've seen
          several times recently where LUO 403.1 was overlooked. However,
          because the new garage was supposed to be on the same footprint as the
          old cottage, a setback variance would not be needed at all.

          In fact, the new garage was not built on the old footprint, so a
          variance from LUO 403.2 was needed. Also, this new footprint brought
          the garage to within 36' of the road, so a front setback variance from
          LUO 202 was also needed.
